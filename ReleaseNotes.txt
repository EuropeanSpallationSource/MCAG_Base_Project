ReleaseNotes:
(This is a very rough overview, the real truth is in "git log")

v0.9.7
  Important: Change the port number from 200 to 5000 for the testrack
  and from 5024 to 5000 for the simulator.

  Change the hardware setup, we have now a new motion test crate MCU "1013"
  Use the encoder attached to the motor, meaning that we now run "closed loop"
  Change the test suite, can be run against any PV pointing to a motor.
  Adapt the scripts starting an IOC to fit to the "CCDB and IOC factory".
  Change the homing to use the low limit switch
  Fix a glitch in the bBusy when running homing sequence:
  bBusy went inactive for a short while.
  Depending on the poller() in EPICS, sometimes MR thougth that the
  homing was done, but it wasn't.


v0.9.6
  Create SolAxis-48-1.cfg, which configures more parameters in the MCU,
    e.g. the homing velocities, to and from the home switch,
    sometimes called cam.
    Remve the connection from EPICS JVEL and HVEL to the MCU,
    in other words, HVEL is now unused in EPICS.
 Improve the error reporting:
   callParamCallbacksUpdateError is used to forward an error to
   EPICS. To be more exact, into the PROBLEM bit.
   Need to change the bBusy handling, but I'm not sure if this change
   was needed, since the motorrecord had been changed as well:

 Update the simulator and test scripts

v0.9.5
  Add a config file for the axis connected to 192.68.88.48.
  Improve the reading: check if a setting is already as it
  should be, by reading the MCU. If yes, skip the update
v0.9.4
  Bug fix: Make it possible to run without an axis config file.      
  move test scripts into test/
  ESS EPICS Environment "EEE":
   compile eldk
   other minor improvements for EEE
v0.9.3
  Make it possible to configure an axis using a config file
  Work around "homing done when hitting a limit switch" in MR
  New Error handling. Define additional EPICS PV:
    $(R)-Err $(R)-ErrRst $(R)-ErrId $(R)-ErrMsg
  More test cases; moved test scripts into test/
  Send MRES from EPICS to the MCU
  8 Axis system: Boy screens and other corrections
v0.9.2
  Use motorClosedLoop from model 3 driver.
  Prepared diffent types of hardware stands:
  single/solo axis, 2 stepper motors
  Add workaround for DLY-STOP problem 
    http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/tech-talk/2015/msg01800.php
  Homing: Implemented homming procedures, see separate document.
  Calculate the accelartion from MR and send it to the MCU
  Error handling: Add PV -Err, Err-Rst
  Handle the amplifier on/off
  Rename the PV according to our naming convention
  Improve the simulator

v0.9.1
  Add basic error and reset handling


v0.9.0
  First released version
