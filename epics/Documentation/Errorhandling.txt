The demo example uses the following additional records to report errors:


IOC:m1.MSTA.SLIP_STALL -  The last action could not be performed as requested.
IOC:m1-Err             -  The MCU reports an error on this axis
IOC:m1-ErrId           -  The error ID reported by the MCU for this axis
IOC:m1-ErrRst          -  Soft Reset for the Axis

Whenever IOC:m1.MSTA.SLIP_STALL is set, this means that the last action had a problem.
Manual investigation is most often needed.
The first step is to look at the ErrId.

Depending on the ErrId, different things need to be done:
- Send a stop to the axis (caput IOC:m1.STOP 1)
  When that not helps,
- Soft reset of the axis (caput IOC:m1-ErrRst 1)

  When the errID is 0x2001C, there is a configuration mismatch.
  Make sure. that the mechanics is in a "safe state", so that the amplifier
  can be switched off.
  Once the amplifier can be switched off, switch it off.
  Wait 2 seconds to see if the error goes away, if yes, you may switch on the amplifier.

Note that IOC:m1.MSTA.SLIP_STALL may be 1 for 2 different reasons:
  a) The driver detected an error, and IOC:m1-Err is 0
  b) The MCU reported an error for the axis, and IOC:m1-Err is 1

In both cases IOC:m1-ErrId will have additional information.
