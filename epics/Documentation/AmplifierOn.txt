How to enable the amplifier from EPICS

The motor reord does not have the concept of an amplifier
(driver) that can switched on or off.

The motor record simply assumes that the amplifier is always on,
(which is the case for most stepper motors).

But when the EtherCAT hardware is powered up,
all amplifiers are off and no axis can be moved.

The driver supports 3 different ways to enable the amplifier:

a) Unconditionally when the EPICS driver starts
b) When the motor is homed via EPICS motor record
c) Manually using the CNEN field in the motor record.

As we don't know today, when and how the amplifier should be enabled,
the EPICS driver can be configured in st.cmd:

a) EssMCAGmotorCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "1", "")
b) EssMCAGmotorCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "2", "")
c) EssMCAGmotorCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "4", "")

Discussion:
a) Is probably how most stepper controllers/amplifiers are configured.
b) is safe in the sense that e.g. the soft limits are invalid when the
   motor is not homed
c) is what some of the new EPICS model 3 drivers do:
   The CNEN field is re-defined to control the amplifier
