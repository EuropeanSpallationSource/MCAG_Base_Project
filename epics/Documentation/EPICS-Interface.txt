The current example database uses the EPICS motor record (MR).

http://aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/motor/

Our driver is a model 3 driver, which allows other records
to be used beside the motor record.

The demo example uses the following records:
IOC:m1-Pos-RB  - Position Readback, in EGU
IOC:m1-JVEL_   - Copy of MR.JVEL
IOC:m1-OFF_    - Copy of MR.OFF
IOC:m1-MRES_   - Copy of MR.MRES
IOC:m1-DIR_    - Copy of MR.DIR
IOC:m1-Err     - See Errorhandling.txt
IOC:m1-ErrId   - See Errorhandling.txt
IOC:m1-ErrRst  - See Errorhandling.txt
IOC:m1-ProcHom - Homing procedure, see Documentation/Homing_Procedures.pdf


Fields that are used from the motorrecord:
- HOMF, HOMR Homing
  The motor is homed according to "ProcHom".
  First the motor moves with JVEL towards e.g. the limit switch.When reached,
  the motor reverts the direction, and searches for the home sensor.
  This is done with HVEL.
  Once succesfully completed, MSTA.HOMED is 1,
  and the motor position is close to the home position.

- JOGF, JOGR Jogging
   is supported, JVEL is used.

- LLM, Soft limits
  Soft limits from MR are send to the motion controller.
  
- MRES
  The MR counts internally in steps,
  and the postion is rounded to the nearest step.
  Movements where the "destination step" is the same as "current step"
  are not done.
  When you know the (micro) step size of your motor, fill it in.
  Otherwise you can't use the motor, or may damage it.
  
- CNEN
  Can be used to switch the amplifier on or off, when the driver is configured
  to do so
  eemcuCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "1", "") # amplifier always on
  eemcuCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "2", "") # (obsolete) amplifier on when homing 
  eemcuCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "4", "") # amplifier is switch on/off with CNEN

--------------------------------
- MSTA
  MSTA.DIRECTION: last raw direction; (0:Negative, 1:Positive)
  - derived from the last movement

  MSTA.DONE: motion is complete.
  - supported

  MSTA.PLUS_LS: plus limit switch has been hit.
  - supported

  MSTA.HOMELS: state of the home limit switch.
  - not supported

  MSTA.Unused
  - unsused

  MSTA.POSITION: closed-loop position control is enabled.
  - Read back if the amplifier is enabled
  
  MSTA.SLIP_STALL: Slip/Stall detected (eg. fatal error)
  - The last action could not be performed as requested.
    Manual investigation may be needed, see Errorhandling.txt
  
  MSTA.HOME: if at home position.
  - not supported

  MSTA.PRESENT: encoder is present.
  - Not supported, Typically the encoder is handled inside the MCU

  MSTA.PROBLEM: driver stopped polling, or hardware problem
  - not used (as the MR would send us STOP commands,
              until the error goes away. We need to do ErrRst)

  MSTA.MOVING: non-zero velocity present.
  - supported

  MSTA.GAIN_SUPPORT: motor supports closed-loop position control.
  - supported, indicates the the amplifier can be turned on with CNEN

  MSTA.COMM_ERR: Controller communication error.
  - supported
  (Note: MR puts record into "COMM INVALID", and resets the bit, so you will
   never see it in the operator screen)

  MSTA.MINUS_LS: minus limit switch has been hit.
  - supported

  MSTA.HOMED: the motor has been homed.
  - supported
