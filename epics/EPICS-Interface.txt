The current example database uses the EPICS motor record (MR).

http://aps.anl.gov/bcda/synApps/motor/

Our driver is a model 3 driver, which allows other records
to be used beside the motor record.

The demo example uses the following records:
IOC:m1-Pos-RB  - Input, position Readback, in EQU
IOC:m1-JVEL_   - Copy of MR.JVEL
IOC:m1-OFF_    - Copy of MR.OFF
IOC:m1-MRES_   - Copy of MR.MRES
IOC:m1-DIR_    - Copy of MR.DIR
IOC:m1-Err     - Input, The axis is in error state.
                 Read out the error id from m1-ErrId. After that,
                 make a write to IOC:m1-ErrId to clear the error.
IOC:m1-ErrId   - Input, Error ID reported from controller
IOC:m1-ErrRst  - output. Writing to this field makes a soft reset and
                 m1-Err shoud go to 0,
IOC:m1-ProcHom - Homing procedure, see Documentation/Homing_Procedures.pdf


Fields that are used from the motorrecord:
- Homing
  HOMF and HOMR have the same function, the motor is homed and stays close to the
  home position.
  First the motor moves with JVEL towards e.g. the limit switch.
  Once reached, the motor reverts the direction, ans searches for the home sensor.
  This is done with HVEL.

- Jogging
  JOGF, JOGR is supported, JVEL is used.

- Soft limits
  Soft limits from MR are send to the motion controller.
  
- MRES
  The MR counts internally in steps,
  and the postion is rounded to the nearest step.
  Movements where the "destination step" is the same as "current step"
  are not done.
  In other words, when you know the (micro) step size of your motor, fill it in.
  Otherwise set it to a small value, like 1 micrometer.
  
- CNEN
  Can be used to switch the amplifier on or off, when the driver is configured
  to do so
  eemcuCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "1", "") # amplifier always on
  eemcuCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "2", "") # (obsolete) amplifier on when homing 
  eemcuCreateAxis("MCU1", "1", "4", "") # amplifier is switch on/off with CNEN

--------------------------------
- Status bits in MSTA
  DIRECTION: last raw direction; (0:Negative, 1:Positive)
  - derived from the last movement

  DONE: motion is complete.
  - supported

  PLUS_LS: plus limit switch has been hit.
  - supported

  HOMELS: state of the home limit switch.
  - supported

  Unused
  - unsused

  POSITION: closed-loop position control is enabled.
  - Read back if the amplifier is enabled
  
  SLIP_STALL: Slip/Stall detected (eg. fatal following error)
  - Follows Err
  
  HOME: if at home position.
  - supported (?)

  PRESENT: encoder is present.
  - Not supported, Typically the encoder is handled inside the MCU

  PROBLEM: driver stopped polling, or hardware problem
  - not used (as the MR would send us STOP commands,
              until the error goes away. We need to do ErrRst)

  MOVING: non-zero velocity present.
  - supported

  GAIN_SUPPORT: motor supports closed-loop position control.
  - supported, indicates the the amplifier can be turned on with CNEN

  COMM_ERR: Controller communication error.
  - supported (Note: MR puts record into "COMM INVALID"

  MINUS_LS: minus limit switch has been hit.
  - supported

  HOMED: the motor has been homed.
  - supported
